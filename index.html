		<h1>Cerene's Official Site</h1>
		<h2>Created 2025, Version 0.4.0</h2>
		<h2>Officially Curated by Cerene CV and <a href="https://pegleg.cbass92.org">Cbass92</a></h2>
		<p>This site is created so as to be a place for me to put my ideas up on display, as well as advertize for my products that I will soon release to the public. I originally created this Website as an interest from a computer science class, partnered with my previous knowledge of some basic html and CSS. I will soon be implementing JavaScript into this, as well as hosting some games I will be trying to make.</p>
	  	
		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>My real name is in fact Cerene(Yes, I know it's unconventional). I was born in 2009 and will graduate by 2028. I have strong interests in anything math or science related, and are naturally gifted in those areas, due to my autism. I have played trombone for 3 years and hope to continue to play far into the future.</p>

		<h1>Linguistic Pursuits</h1>
		    <h2>Scriptmaking</h2>
		    <p>I have been working on making alternate alphabets for english, as well as cyphers for encoding data since a very young age. These used to only use the english alphabet and numbers, but have recently spiraled into more complex situations. I have begun to incorporate my own sounds, symbols, and subsystems within it to create a rich and complex writing system for a language I plan to make. </p>
		    <p>I currently have three languages that I am trying to make, one of them being a sign language for deaf speakers, one of them involving a very rigid structure for word formation and for speech, and one being based off of ideas and formed casually.</p>
		    <p>Most of my ideas come from <a href="https://omniglot.com">Omniglot</a></p>
